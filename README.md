# A web-based tool for modelling, visualising, and generating interactions in interactive art

This site presents a modelling tool for describing and visualising interactions. This tool is built upon a relational model previously developed for describing different forms of interaction in the context of interactive artworks. A detailed description of the model can be found in [this publication](https://isea2023.ensad.fr/#towards-models-of-co-located-interaction-in-interactive-art). The model starts by identifying the individual actors participating in the interaction each referred to as an element. To describe an interaction, the model examines the actions performed by the elements that influence other elements. Following an action, one or more forms of communication are created and directed at (an)other element(s). The means of communication can be either direct or mediated. The access to communication can be either public or private. Finally, the model examines the effects of communication on the interaction, such as its functions and impacts on other elements. 

You can access the tool via [this link](https://danxxxu.github.io/relational-model/).

The tool is developed as part of a PhD research by Dan Xu, supervised by Maarten H. Lamers, Edwin van der Heide, Fons J. Verbeek
